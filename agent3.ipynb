    "\n",
    "- **Frontend:** React with Redux Framework, CSS Flexbox and Grid. It will be optimized using code splitting and lazy loading to ensure lightweight performance across devices/screens sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backend:** Node.js Express Server running on a secure HTTPS environment (TLS encryption). This server will expose RESTful API endpoints for the CRUD operations of tasks, team members' assignments and role access controls. The backend is using PostgreSQL as its database with Sequelize ORM tool to handle SQL queries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database:** PostgreSQL Database designed in a way that optimizes read/write performance by creating separate indices for frequently queried data (task status, deadlines etc.) and implementing foreign key constraints between the tables Tasks, Team_members, Roles etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Third Party Integrations:** The application will integrate with an existing SMTP email system to send notifications through emails using Nodemailer - a popular Email Library for node that provides easy integration of SMTP servers and APIs within our Express Backend server itself without any external API calls, ensuring seamless notification delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Architecture Diagram ### \n",
    "The architecture diagram would show the client-side React App interacting with various backend endpoints via HTTPS (Secure RESTful services). The main components of this system are as follows: Task Management Service on our Node.js server, a PostgreSQL Database serving data to both Services and also providing an API endpoint for generating CSV reports which is consumed by the manager dashboard component built with React Native's capabilities ensuring mobile compatibility due its lightweight nature. The User Roles (Admin/Manager) are managed at Service level where each user login attempt triggers Role-based access control checks before granting or denying permissions to specific features and data based on their role, this is done via middleware in Express backend that intercepts all incoming requests for the various endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Endpoints ### \n",
    "1. `POST /api/tasks` - Create a task with relevant details such as title, description etc., by default it will assign to unassigned team members and set deadline based on input parameters or defaults (if not provided).\n",
    "2. `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Read operation for getting the complete list of tasks assigned to specific user(s) along with their details such as status, assignee etc., if id is empty then it returns all unassigned tasks and pending ones only.\n",
    "3. `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` - Update task like title or description; assigning new team members can be done in this end-point too by specifying which user to assign the changes to via JSON body payload of PATCH request, mark as complete operation will also work here if status is changed from pending -> marked_complete.\n",
    "4. `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task based on id provided through GET or POST requests (user confirmation required). \n",
    "5. `POST /api/assignments` and `GET /api/assignments?userId={...}&teamId={...}`: Create assignment of tasks to specific team members for their individual performance tracking, get all assignments assigned within the last month etc., which also includes mark_as_complete as a special operation.\n",
    "6. `POST /api/reminders` - Send an automated reminder when deadline is approaching and not completed yet based on current time vs task due date comparison (automation logic handled at service level). \n",
    "7. The manager dashboard endpoint `/dashboard`, which will be secured via role-based access controls, to view the progress of tasks assigned with each team member's status within a specific project/department and also provide CSV report download functionality for task completion data (using Nodemailer integration if needed). \n",
    "8. The application is using OAuth2 protocol along with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) mechanism ensuring secure login access, which helps in role-based permissions control as well by checking roles embedded within JWT token payload at every protected endpoints request validation step to grant or deny operation permission based on user's authenticated identity and their assigned role.\n",
    "9. Integration with existing email system for notifications is handled internally using Nodemailer (SMTP library) in our server-side Express backend, which sends out emails upon task creation/editing & assignment as well as when the reminders are triggered or reports requested by managers on dashboard based solethd of provided criteria.\n",
    "10. Report generation functionality will be handled via `/api/reports` endpoint with CSV format output that can be downloaded directly from manager dashboard, which is built using React Native framework to ensure mobile compatibility as well due its lightweight nature and performance capabilities when it comes across multiple screen sizes (via responsive design principles). The reports themselves are generated on-the-fly based on the request parameters in query string or JSON body payload of POST requests.\n",
    "11. For team member management, endpoints like `GET /api/team_members` & `POST /api/teams/{id}/member?userId={...}` would be included for managers to view all their assigned members and also add new ones respectively; this enables better performance tracking of individual user contributions as well.\n",
    "12. The frontend UI design principles are based on responsive web practices, ensuring the application scales smoothly across desktop & mobile devices by using CSS Grid/Flexbox techniques in combination with React component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design to maintain consistent look and feel of various elements throughout multiple screen sizes while keeping accessibility standards (WCAG) as well.\n",
    "13. Finally, data validation and business logic are encapsulated at the service layer using middleware functions that filter all incoming requests before they reach API endpoints for security checks/permissions based on roles etc., to prevent any unauthorized or malicious actions by potential attackers trying their luck through exposed web services (which also helps in improving system performance due reduction of unnecessary computation at request validation step). \n",
    "14. Error handling mechanism is implemented via custom error handlers & exception classes built within the Node server code, which provides detailed and user-friendly feedback messages whenever something goes wrong with requests/responses during application usage or data processing; this helps in maintaining good user experience along as well while ensuring necessary audit trails for troubleshooting purposes.\n",
    "15. The entire system architecture is designed based on principles of scalability, security & performance optimization so that it can handle heavy traffic loads with minimal latency/delay during peak hours or eventful scenarios (either in terms of user interactions within application itself OR through third-party integrations). This ensures reliability for both internal company usage as well when partnering organizations get involved via API calls; all the while keeping system architecture clean & maintainable by following best practices such as modularity, code splitting/lazy loading etc. \n",
    "16. Code documentation is maintained using JSDoc comments within JavaScript files to help future developers understand how specific components work together along with some inline examples wherever needed for quick reference; this also helps in reducing development turnaround times by allowing new team members or external contractors easier access without much context setup required initially due familiarity gained through well-documented codebase.\n",
    "17. Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is established via Jenkins using GitHub source control repository; this provides automated testing & deployment scripts that run nightly builds along with running suite of unit tests to validate functionality changes, enhancements or fixes before pushing any new features into master branch ready for production release at scheduled intervals based on business needs.\n",
    "18. Last but not least - monitoring tools like Prometheus alongside Grafana dashboards setup within the backend server environment will ensure proactive performance tracking & alerting capabilities when anomalies are detected (either in terms of resource utilization or user interaction patterns); this helps maintain system health continuously by providing real-time insights on various metrics along as well which also serves to identify potential areas for optimization/improvements down the line based off actual usage data captured during operation hours. This overall robust & effective architecture specification provides all necessary components required within our task management web application while ensuring secure access controls, efficient collaboration features among team members etc., meeting given objectives along as well optimizing user experience across multiple devices/screen sizes without compromising on any quality assurance aspect throughout entire development lifecycle.\n",

    "- Styling: Tailwind CSS\n",
    "- Build Tools: Vite\n",
    "- Client-side Data Persistence: localStorage (for simulating data storage until backend is implemented)\n",

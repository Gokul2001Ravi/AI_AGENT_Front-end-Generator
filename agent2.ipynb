      "This system architecture will be built using a combination of technologies that include but are not limited to JavaScript for the front end and NodeJS/Express.js as backend due to their efficiency in handling large scale applications such as this task management web application with features like realtime updates, JSON data exchange etc., while MongoDB or PostgreSQL would serve database purposes because they provide flexible schemas that can accommodate different types of databases depending on the use case at hand and allow for scalability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## API Endpoints (CRUD Operations): ## \n",
      "The system will expose CRUD operations through RESTful APIs to maintain data consistency across all client devices/environments, ensuring a seamless user experience while also facilitating integration with other systems such as email notifications using an SMTP server. Below is the example of how these can be set up in ExpressJS:\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Frontend:** React with Redux Framework, CSS Flexbox and Grid. It will be optimized using code splitting and lazy loading to ensure lightweight performance across devices/screens sizes. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Backend:** Node.js Express Server running on a secure HTTPS environment (TLS encryption). This server will expose RESTful API endpoints for the CRUD operations of tasks, team members' assignments and role access controls. The backend is using PostgreSQL as its database with Sequelize ORM tool to handle SQL queries effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Database:** PostgreSQL Database designed in a way that optimizes read/write performance by creating separate indices for frequently queried data (task status, deadlines etc.) and implementing foreign key constraints between the tables Tasks, Team_members, Roles etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Third Party Integrations:** The application will integrate with an existing SMTP email system to send notifications through emails using Nodemailer - a popular Email Library for node that provides easy integration of SMTP servers and APIs within our Express Backend server itself without any external API calls, ensuring seamless notification delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "### System Architecture Diagram ### \n",
      "The architecture diagram would show the client-side React App interacting with various backend endpoints via HTTPS (Secure RESTful services). The main components of this system are as follows: Task Management Service on our Node.js server, a PostgreSQL Database serving data to both Services and also providing an API endpoint for generating CSV reports which is consumed by the manager dashboard component built with React Native's capabilities ensuring mobile compatibility due its lightweight nature. The User Roles (Admin/Manager) are managed at Service level where each user login attempt triggers Role-based access control checks before granting or denying permissions to specific features and data based on their role, this is done via middleware in Express backend that intercepts all incoming requests for the various endpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "### API Endpoints ### \n",
      "1. `POST /api/tasks` - Create a task with relevant details such as title, description etc., by default it will assign to unassigned team members and set deadline based on input parameters or defaults (if not provided).\n",
      "2. `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Read operation for getting the complete list of tasks assigned to specific user(s) along with their details such as status, assignee etc., if id is empty then it returns all unassigned tasks and pending ones only.\n",
      "3. `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` - Update task like title or description; assigning new team members can be done in this end-point too by specifying which user to assign the changes to via JSON body payload of PATCH request, mark as complete operation will also work here if status is changed from pending -> marked_complete.\n",
      "4. `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task based on id provided through GET or POST requests (user confirmation required). \n",
      "5. `POST /api/assignments` and `GET /api/assignments?userId={...}&teamId={...}`: Create assignment of tasks to specific team members for their individual performance tracking, get all assignments assigned within the last month etc., which also includes mark_as_complete as a special operation.\n",
      "6. `POST /api/reminders` - Send an automated reminder when deadline is approaching and not completed yet based on current time vs task due date comparison (automation logic handled at service level). \n",
      "7. The manager dashboard endpoint `/dashboard`, which will be secured via role-based access controls, to view the progress of tasks assigned with each team member's status within a specific project/department and also provide CSV report download functionality for task completion data (using Nodemailer integration if needed). \n",
      "8. The application is using OAuth2 protocol along with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) mechanism ensuring secure login access, which helps in role-based permissions control as well by checking roles embedded within JWT token payload at every protected endpoints request validation step to grant or deny operation permission based on user's authenticated identity and their assigned role.\n",
      "9. Integration with existing email system for notifications is handled internally using Nodemailer (SMTP library) in our server-side Express backend, which sends out emails upon task creation/editing & assignment as well as when the reminders are triggered or reports requested by managers on dashboard based solethd of provided criteria.\n",
      "10. Report generation functionality will be handled via `/api/reports` endpoint with CSV format output that can be downloaded directly from manager dashboard, which is built using React Native framework to ensure mobile compatibility as well due its lightweight nature and performance capabilities when it comes across multiple screen sizes (via responsive design principles). The reports themselves are generated on-the-fly based on the request parameters in query string or JSON body payload of POST requests.\n",
      "11. For team member management, endpoints like `GET /api/team_members` & `POST /api/teams/{id}/member?userId={...}` would be included for managers to view all their assigned members and also add new ones respectively; this enables better performance tracking of individual user contributions as well.\n",
      "12. The frontend UI design principles are based on responsive web practices, ensuring the application scales smoothly across desktop & mobile devices by using CSS Grid/Flexbox techniques in combination with React component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design to maintain consistent look and feel of various elements throughout multiple screen sizes while keeping accessibility standards (WCAG) as well.\n",
      "13. Finally, data validation and business logic are encapsulated at the service layer using middleware functions that filter all incoming requests before they reach API endpoints for security checks/permissions based on roles etc., to prevent any unauthorized or malicious actions by potential attackers trying their luck through exposed web services (which also helps in improving system performance due reduction of unnecessary computation at request validation step). \n",
      "14. Error handling mechanism is implemented via custom error handlers & exception classes built within the Node server code, which provides detailed and user-friendly feedback messages whenever something goes wrong with requests/responses during application usage or data processing; this helps in maintaining good user experience along as well while ensuring necessary audit trails for troubleshooting purposes.\n",
      "15. The entire system architecture is designed based on principles of scalability, security & performance optimization so that it can handle heavy traffic loads with minimal latency/delay during peak hours or eventful scenarios (either in terms of user interactions within application itself OR through third-party integrations). This ensures reliability for both internal company usage as well when partnering organizations get involved via API calls; all the while keeping system architecture clean & maintainable by following best practices such as modularity, code splitting/lazy loading etc. \n",
      "16. Code documentation is maintained using JSDoc comments within JavaScript files to help future developers understand how specific components work together along with some inline examples wherever needed for quick reference; this also helps in reducing development turnaround times by allowing new team members or external contractors easier access without much context setup required initially due familiarity gained through well-documented codebase.\n",
      "17. Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is established via Jenkins using GitHub source control repository; this provides automated testing & deployment scripts that run nightly builds along with running suite of unit tests to validate functionality changes, enhancements or fixes before pushing any new features into master branch ready for production release at scheduled intervals based on business needs.\n",
      "18. Last but not least - monitoring tools like Prometheus alongside Grafana dashboards setup within the backend server environment will ensure proactive performance tracking & alerting capabilities when anomalies are detected (either in terms of resource utilization or user interaction patterns); this helps maintain system health continuously by providing real-time insights on various metrics along as well which also serves to identify potential areas for optimization/improvements down the line based off actual usage data captured during operation hours. This overall robust & effective architecture specification provides all necessary components required within our task management web application while ensuring secure access controls, efficient collaboration features among team members etc., meeting given objectives along as well optimizing user experience across multiple devices/screen sizes without compromising on any quality assurance aspect throughout entire development lifecycle.\n",

      "- **TaskList**: A dynamic list component to display tasks and allows interaction (editing, marking complete or deleting). It will be reusable across the application with conditional rendering based on user roles using Redux selectors for data flow control between UI elements. Component props passed into `TaskList` are managed by Redux state updates through dispatched actions triggered from various parts of our app's React components, maintaining consistency and reactivity throughout the task management experience without prop drilling.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **CreateEditModal**: A modal component that pops up when a user needs to create or edit tasks (as contextually appropriate). This will be managed by Redux actions for submitting changes back into global state. It handles form submission, validation and provides visual cues on progress completion using localUI/modals libraries if required.\n",

The choice of local storage offers simplicity in implementation while maintaining essential user experience without relying on server resources or realtime updates which our frontend application doesn't demand currently due to being a standalone, React app with immediate synchronization capabilities as needed by the PRD objectives and functionalities listed above - except for backend integrations.\n",

We’ll employ breakpoints in our stylesheets where specific task or dashboard layout adjustments are needed based on viewport width measurements using media queries as required by Tailwind CSS conventions if necessary customization beyond provided classes is expected (not directly related to the backend, but critical for frontend user experience).\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Notifications**: Implemented through a combination of modals/alerts and localStorage notifications that prompt users about pending tasks or updates. These will be triggered within components like `TaskList` when changes occur in Redux state reflecting task deadlines approaching, using the setTimeout function to simulate timer functionality as no backend-triggered reminders are handled by this specification due to being a frontend application without realtime server communication requirements specified at present.\n",

Since this function doesn't rely on backend processing or server communication at present and is within our frontend-only scope without SMTP integration (as specified in your requirements), we can assume it will serve the necessary data directly from `localStorage` once tasks are completed, which could be further refined to use a library like FileSaver.js if direct download capabilities were needed beyond this specification's current bounds and technological constraints given by PRD instructions (not included as per specified scope).\n",

      "- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first, mobile-first styling to ensure responsive design elements. This allows customization of components without complex hacks or additional plugins/modules beyond what is needed by default with Vite and React. The website will use dark mode as a primary theme which can be easily toggled using JavaScript based on user preference via localStorage state persistence, if desired.\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer --save-dev\n",
      "  npx create-tailwindcss my-react-app && cd my-react-app\n",
      "  vite build # initial setup with Tailwind CSS using Vite CLI after project creation\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Build Tool:** Vite, due to its modern approach and fast development server. It's also chosen for production builds because of its performance benefits in delivering static assets quickly over the network when deployed on a CDN or similar infrastructure without an actual backend implementation required as this application is frontend only with simulated back-end behavior client-side using JavaScript alerts, modals, and localStorage.\n",
      "  \n",
      "## Components\n",
      "The React components will be organized under different folders for better maintainability: `components`,`layouts`, and `hooks`. The following main components are expected to form the core of this portfolio website based on PRD requirements:\n",
      "- **Home** (Hero Section): A component containing background image/video, heading \"Hello [Your Name]\", a brief summary about yourself. This section will use React hooks and context API for state management if necessary. The CSS animations or transitions can be implemented directly in the styling with Tailwind CSS classes applied to manage smooth user experience as per Acceptance Criteria #5, ensuring animation on mount/unmount scenarios based on scroll events (e.g., React hooks like `useEffect`).\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **About**: A component showcasing a profile picture alongside the heading with an accompanying short bio section using Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling as needed to ensure legibility across devices, fulfilling Acceptance Criteria #4. Responsiveness will also be tested on different screen sizes within development tools such as Chrome DevTools or browser simulators (e.g., Firefox Developer Edition).\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Projects**: A grid component composed of multiple `ProjectCard` components to display project cards with titles, images/videos related to the projects showcased in PRD; each card should include short descriptions and buttons for more details or external links (if needed) that trigger client alerts using plain JavaScript.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Skills**: A dynamic list component of skill icons linked to brief descriptions, which uses state management via Redux provided by the `redux` library included in the project dependencies along with React Persistence API for localStorage data access as per PRD requirements (Acceptance Criteria #8). These skills can be displayed using a grid layout that adapts to screen size and orientation.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Contact**: A simple form component containing fields like name, email, message which will invoke Redux actions/thunks for state management when submitted via the frontend only (Acceptance Criteria #3). LocalStorage can be used here as well after submission if needed to simulate a backend persistence mechanism.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Pagination**: Although not explicitly detailed in PRD, paginated project listings are necessary and should also use React hooks for state management of current page or total pages when dealing with many projects (Acceptance Criteria #2). Responsive design principles will ensure this component's adaptability to various devices.\n",
      "  \n",
      "## Data Storage & Persistence\n",
      "- **LocalStorage**: As per the PRD, project data and form state are stored in `localStorage` using JSON methods for serialization/deserialization (Acceptance Criteria #10). This approach provides a lightweight solution to simulate persistence without actual backend services. Data synchronized with local storage can be managed via Redux-persist middleware, allowing components like Skills and Contact form data state persist between page refreshes or browser closures for full functionality on return visits:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  npm install redux-persist react-redux # required dependencies if using Persistence with React/Redux setup.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  // Redux Store configuration snippet integrating persistence middleware (not complete code but guiding structure)\n",
      "  import { createStore } from 'redux';\n",
      "  import { persistReducer, persistEntity } from 'redux-persist';\n",
      "  const rootReducer = combineReducers({\n",
      "    // Existing Redux reducers go here...\n",
      "  });\n",
      "  \n",
      "  export default function persistedReducer(state, action) {\n",
      "    return Object.keys(rootReducer).reduce((reducedState, key) => ({ ...reducedState[key](state, rootReducer(action)), }), initialState);\n",
      " 0}\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **JSON Methods**: `localStorage` will be used to store and retrieve project data with proper encoding/decoding using the native JavaScript methods for JSON manipulation. Redux actions such as FetchProjectsAction (Acceptance Criteria #1) should handle fetching this simulated API call, providing initial state on first load or retrieving from localStorage on subsequent visits:\n",
      "  ```javascript\n",
      "  // Example action to simulate project data loading into the store - replace with actual Redux logic and structure.\n",
      "  const FetchProjectsAction = () => { /* ... */ };\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  \n",
      "## UI Features\n",
      "- **Responsive Design**: All components will be responsive using Tailwind CSS utility classes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices as per Acceptance Criteria #4. Media queries and breakpoints in combination with the framework'ties grid layouts for adaptability to screen sizes are expected techniques used herein (Acceptance Criteria #12).\n",
      "- **Animations & Transitions**: CSS transitions or JavaScript animations using libraries like `framer-motion` can be included for engaging user interactions as part of the smooth experience mentioned in Acceptance Criteria. These should trigger based on scroll events, element entrance/exit states (e.g., visibility checks), etc.:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  npm install framer-motion # Required package to add animations and transitions using Motion API or CSS Animation classes from Tailwind.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  // Example usage of Motion for a project card component - replace with actual code integrating motion into React components:\n",
      "  import { motion } from 'framer-motion';\n",
      "  <ProjectCard>\n",
      "    ... # Project Card Content...\n",
      "    <motion.div className=\"projectBox\" initialLayout={[0,0]} layoutWhenEntered={{ x: \"50%\", y: \"10%\" }} transition={{ duration: .2 }}> {/* Motion properties here */} </ProjectCard>\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Access Control** and user roles are not required in this context as the site is single-user oriented with no login functionality. However, if such features were to be considered for future enhancements or different projects requirements (e.g., team portfolio), pseudocode/mock implementations could simulate role checks within JavaScript functions handling form submissions and API interactions:\n",
      "  ```javascript\n",
      "  // Pseudo-function simulating backend access control - not required as per PRD, but illustrative for future scalability needs.\n",
      "  const validateUserRole = (userInput) => { /* ... */ };\n",
      "  \n",
      "  if(validateUserRole('guest') === false) { alert(\"Access Denied!\"); } // Client-side mock access control logic example based on Acceptance Criteria #7 and #9 - replace with actual implementation.\n",

      "3. **src/components/ContactForm.jsx**: Contains contact form fields for name, email, and message, along with submit button. \n",
      "4. **src/components/Footer.jsx**: Footer section containing social media links or other relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "## State Management\n",
      "1. Redux store: Root state that holds the entire state tree of the application. \n",
      "2. Redux slices: Sections of the Redux store where each contains action creators and reducers for a specific feature (e.g., navigationState, projectDetailsState).\n",
      "3. Context API: Can be used instead of Redux if the state is simple enough that it can be lifted to parent components without needing more complex data management solutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Storage\n",
      "1. **localStorage**: To save user's theme preference or other settings which are not critical for the app functioning. This could also store temporary data such as search queries, etc. But is cleared when the browser tab is closed.\n",
      "2. **sessionStorage**: Could be used to remember a user’s login status or similar non-critical information between browser sessions. \n",
      "3. None: The project is purely frontend and doesn't need server-side storage. \n",
      "\n",
      "## UI Features\n",
      "1. Responsive Design: Ensured by Tailwind CSS utility classes that respond to screen size and device orientation changes.\n",
      "2. Animations: Could be achieved using libraries like Framer Motion or built-in React Transitions for smooth transitions between states.\n",
      "3. Forms: Created in the ContactForm component ensuring proper form validation is also handled at the frontend. \n",
      "4. Role-based access: Not mentioned, but could easily be added with roles and permissions feature provided by backend services or APIs.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Tech Stack:\n",
      "- **Frontend Framework**: React.js, always implemented as per the requirement of this project.\n",
      "- **CSS Framework and Custom Styles**: Tailwind CSS for utility classes combined with `src/index.css` containing custom styles or overrides if necessary (default to empty).\n",
      "- **Build Tool**: Vite.js will be used instead of Create React App due to performance considerations mentioned in the PRD. Ensure that all dependencies are installed globally and local project setup is done through `npm init vite@latest`. Configuration should align with our requirements for hot reloading, optimization, etc., found within `./vite.config.js`.\n",
      "- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (rtk) will be the default state management solution due to its simplicity and maintainability in managing navigation states like `currentSection` or project detail expansions as stated above unless specified for a very simple component where Context API might suffice instead. Slices should correspond with individual components that require their own slice of data if needed, mapped out below:\n",
      "- **Client-side Storage**: None required due to the nature of this frontend-only project (no backend services necessary). However, developers are encouraged to implement localStorage/sessionStorage for simple caching mechanisms as per additional needs.\n",
      "- **Other Libraries or Dependencies**: Not specified but generally expected standard libraries such as `axios` for potential API interactions should be installed via npm with the command `npm install axios`. Developers can refer to our `./package.json` file for a list of mandatory dependencies, which will include React and Vite (among other non-specified but commonly used packages).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Mandatory Files:\n",
      "- src/App.jsx - Entry point for the application that renders `<BrowserRouter>` component containing all nested screens using routes mapped below in section 3. Should always be included due to its fundamental role as entry and exit points of our app' endpoints, it should include essential navigation components such as `Header` or a menu item if needed based on user roles (none for this project).\n",
      "- src/main.jsx - Main JavaScript file where the React application is instantiated with createRoot API provided by Vite upon hot module replacement: \n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "import { createRoot } from 'meteor/react-vite'\n",
      "createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!)```\n",
      "- src/index.css - Contains custom styles or overrides for Tailwind CSS if required, otherwise empty (to be filled as per design guidelines).\n",
      "- ./tailwind.config.js and ./.vitestrc – These configuration files should contain setup according to our project's specific needs; however they are not detailed in the PRD provided so can remain standard unless further customization is specified later on by developers or stakeholders with experience overrides being possible if required (mandatory).\n",
      "- package.json - The root of all npm installations and configurations, ensuring that React, Vite, Redux Toolkit (rtk), Tailwind CSS are listed as dependencies along with other standard libraries like `axios`, etc. should be included in the \"dependencies\" section for this project:\n",
      "```javascript \n",

      "## Screens and Components Mapping to File Paths (Sample):\n",
      "1. src/components/Header.jsx - Handles the top navigation bar with a potential dropdown for user roles if required in future expansions: [Mapping] `src/components/Navbar` due to header mapping change request from PRD, which is now broken down into Header and other components as per above notes (mandatory).\n",
      "2. src/screens/HomeScreen.jsx - Represents the landing page with project cards that lead users through sections of portfolio: [Mapping] `src/components/` -> `[mapping]` `/screens` for each individual component mapped out in this section, as detailed below (mandatory).\n",
      "3. src/components/ProjectCard.jsx - A reusable Project card UI Component with an image, title, description and buttons within the projects screen: [Mapping] `src/components/` -> `[mapping]` `/project-cards` for mapping to individual project cards as detailed below (mandatory).\n",
      "4. src/screens/AboutScreen.jsx - Displays information about the person or organization profiled on the website, with potential contact form integration: [Mapping] `src/components/` -> `[mapping]` `/about` mapped out in this section for individual components as detailed below (mandatory).\n",
      "5. src/screens/ProjectsScreen.jsx - Displays all portfolio projects using project cards within a grid or list format, with options to filter by skill level etc.: [Mapping] `src/components/` -> `[mapping]` `/projects` for mapping out the individual components as detailed below (mandatory).\n",
      "6. src/screens/SkillsScreen.jsx - Displays skills and experiences of profiled person or organization, with links to more information if necessary: [Mapping] `src/components/` -> `[mapping]` `/skills` for mapping out the individual components as detailed below (mandatory).\n",
      "7. src/screens/ContactFormScreen.jsx - A form integrated within a Contact Us section that allows users or employers to fill in their information and submit messages: [Mapping] `src/components/` -> `[mapping]` `/contact` mapped out for individual components as detailed below (mandatory).\n",
      "## State Management File Paths:\n",
      "- src/features/navigationSlice.js - Custom slice from Redux Toolkit managing navigation state like current section and any expandable sections, with mapStateToProps or useSelector hook if necessary to connect it within the React components where needed (mandatory). This will handle smooth scrolling experience by updating `useLocation` in `<BrowserRouter>`.\n",
      "## Data Storage File Paths: \n",
      "- None required as per PRD. However developers are encouraged for simple caching mechanisms using localStorage/sessionStorage on their own discretion and requirements, if necessary (none). If not needed based on the project's scope or complexity level.\n",
      "## UI Features Mapping to File Paths: \n",
      "- Responsive design - Ensured by Tailwind CSS combined with React components that are responsive out of box without additional configuration as this is already a standard feature in Vite and Tailwind (mandatory). This includes media queries, flexible layout elements etc. mapped to their respective component file paths:\n",
      "- Animations & Transitions - Using `react-transition-group` or custom hooks developed for animating components on enter/exit transitions during scroll changes with proper CSS classes as required by the PRD (mandatory). These should be detailed within each relevant screen and possibly card to enhance user experience.\n",
      "- Form Integration & Field Validation - As specified in Acceptance Criteria, ensuring that forms for contact submission include fields such as name, email, message etc., with proper validation using React Hooks like `useState` or a form library if necessary (mandatory). This should be detailed within the ContactFormScreen component path.\n",
      "- Responsive Navigation - Based on Acceptance Criteria requiring smooth scrolling between sections and possibly dropdown for user roles as specified in PRD, this feature will use React Router's `<Link>` components with `to` property pointing to different screen paths: [Mapping] Each link mapped individually within the header component based on project changes.\n",
      "- Project Details Expansion/Collapse - Based on Acceptance Criteria requiring expanded detail view for projects which includes images, titles and descriptions etc., this will be implemented using React's state management with `useState` or custom hook (mandatory). Screens should map to their respective expansion states in the navigationSlice file path.\n",
      "- Project Navigation - As per PRD specifying that users can navigate through sections without backend interaction, ensuring client-side routing and link rendering within `<BrowserRouter>` component at App entry point: [Mapping] Each section mapped out for smooth transition as detailed above (mandatory).\n",
      "- Modern & Lightweight Design Aesthetics - Based on the project's requirements to have a modern and lightweight design, this will be ensured by using CSS framework TailwindCSS alongside our custom styles located in `src/index.css`, with file mapping provided for each major component styling if required: [Mapping] Customized or standard components mapped within their respective files as needed (mandatory).\n",
      "- Implementation Details - All the specifications from Acceptance Criteria and other PRD points such as animations, transitions etc., should be explicitly detailed in relevant screens/components mapping sections along with proper hooks used for state management: [Mapping] Specific animation or transition implementations within components.\n",

    "\n",
    "# - **Backend:** Node.js Express Server running on a secure HTTPS environment (TLS encryption). This server will expose RESTful API endpoints for the CRUD operations of tasks, team members' assignments and role access controls. The backend is using PostgreSQL as its database with Sequelize ORM tool to handle SQL queries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Database:** PostgreSQL Database designed in a way that optimizes read/write performance by creating separate indices for frequently queried data (task status, deadlines etc.) and implementing foreign key constraints between the tables Tasks, Team_members, Roles etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Third Party Integrations:** The application will integrate with an existing SMTP email system to send notifications through emails using Nodemailer - a popular Email Library for node that provides easy integration of SMTP servers and APIs within our Express Backend server itself without any external API calls, ensuring seamless notification delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### System Architecture Diagram ### \n",
    "# The architecture diagram would show the client-side React App interacting with various backend endpoints via HTTPS (Secure RESTful services). The main components of this system are as follows: Task Management Service on our Node.js server, a PostgreSQL Database serving data to both Services and also providing an API endpoint for generating CSV reports which is consumed by the manager dashboard component built with React Native's capabilities ensuring mobile compatibility due its lightweight nature. The User Roles (Admin/Manager) are managed at Service level where each user login attempt triggers Role-based access control checks before granting or denying permissions to specific features and data based on their role, this is done via middleware in Express backend that intercepts all incoming requests for the various endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### API Endpoints ### \n",
    "# 1. `POST /api/tasks` - Create a task with relevant details such as title, description etc., by default it will assign to unassigned team members and set deadline based on input parameters or defaults (if not provided).\n",
    "# 2. `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Read operation for getting the complete list of tasks assigned to specific user(s) along with their details such as status, assignee etc., if id is empty then it returns all unassigned tasks and pending ones only.\n",
    "# 3. `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` - Update task like title or description; assigning new team members can be done in this end-point too by specifying which user to assign the changes to via JSON body payload of PATCH request, mark as complete operation will also work here if status is changed from pending -> marked_complete.\n",
    "# 4. `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` - Delete a task based on id provided through GET or POST requests (user confirmation required). \n",
    "# 5. `POST /api/assignments` and `GET /api/assignments?userId={...}&teamId={...}`: Create assignment of tasks to specific team members for their individual performance tracking, get all assignments assigned within the last month etc., which also includes mark_as_complete as a special operation.\n",
    "# 6. `POST /api/reminders` - Send an automated reminder when deadline is approaching and not completed yet based on current time vs task due date comparison (automation logic handled at service level). \n",
    "# 7. The manager dashboard endpoint `/dashboard`, which will be secured via role-based access controls, to view the progress of tasks assigned with each team member's status within a specific project/department and also provide CSV report download functionality for task completion data (using Nodemailer integration if needed). \n",
    "# 8. The application is using OAuth2 protocol along with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) mechanism ensuring secure login access, which helps in role-based permissions control as well by checking roles embedded within JWT token payload at every protected endpoints request validation step to grant or deny operation permission based on user's authenticated identity and their assigned role.\n",
    "# 9. Integration with existing email system for notifications is handled internally using Nodemailer (SMTP library) in our server-side Express backend, which sends out emails upon task creation/editing & assignment as well as when the reminders are triggered or reports requested by managers on dashboard based solethd of provided criteria.\n",
    "# 10. Report generation functionality will be handled via `/api/reports` endpoint with CSV format output that can be downloaded directly from manager dashboard, which is built using React Native framework to ensure mobile compatibility as well due its lightweight nature and performance capabilities when it comes across multiple screen sizes (via responsive design principles). The reports themselves are generated on-the-fly based on the request parameters in query string or JSON body payload of POST requests.\n",
    "# 11. For team member management, endpoints like `GET /api/team_members` & `POST /api/teams/{id}/member?userId={...}` would be included for managers to view all their assigned members and also add new ones respectively; this enables better performance tracking of individual user contributions as well.\n",
    "# 12. The frontend UI design principles are based on responsive web practices, ensuring the application scales smoothly across desktop & mobile devices by using CSS Grid/Flexbox techniques in combination with React component libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design to maintain consistent look and feel of various elements throughout multiple screen sizes while keeping accessibility standards (WCAG) as well.\n",
    "# 13. Finally, data validation and business logic are encapsulated at the service layer using middleware functions that filter all incoming requests before they reach API endpoints for security checks/permissions based on roles etc., to prevent any unauthorized or malicious actions by potential attackers trying their luck through exposed web services (which also helps in improving system performance due reduction of unnecessary computation at request validation step). \n",
    "# 14. Error handling mechanism is implemented via custom error handlers & exception classes built within the Node server code, which provides detailed and user-friendly feedback messages whenever something goes wrong with requests/responses during application usage or data processing; this helps in maintaining good user experience along as well while ensuring necessary audit trails for troubleshooting purposes.\n",
    "# 15. The entire system architecture is designed based on principles of scalability, security & performance optimization so that it can handle heavy traffic loads with minimal latency/delay during peak hours or eventful scenarios (either in terms of user interactions within application itself OR through third-party integrations). This ensures reliability for both internal company usage as well when partnering organizations get involved via API calls; all the while keeping system architecture clean & maintainable by following best practices such as modularity, code splitting/lazy loading etc. \n",
    "# 16. Code documentation is maintained using JSDoc comments within JavaScript files to help future developers understand how specific components work together along with some inline examples wherever needed for quick reference; this also helps in reducing development turnaround times by allowing new team members or external contractors easier access without much context setup required initially due familiarity gained through well-documented codebase.\n",
    "# 17. Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is established via Jenkins using GitHub source control repository; this provides automated testing & deployment scripts that run nightly builds along with running suite of unit tests to validate functionality changes, enhancements or fixes before pushing any new features into master branch ready for production release at scheduled intervals based on business needs.\n",
    "# 18. Last but not least - monitoring tools like Prometheus alongside Grafana dashboards setup within the backend server environment will ensure proactive performance tracking & alerting capabilities when anomalies are detected (either in terms of resource utilization or user interaction patterns); this helps maintain system health continuously by providing real-time insights on various metrics along as well which also serves to identify potential areas for optimization/improvements down the line based off actual usage data captured during operation hours. This overall robust & effective architecture specification provides all necessary components required within our task management web application while ensuring secure access controls, efficient collaboration features among team members etc., meeting given objectives along as well optimizing user experience across multiple devices/screen sizes without compromising on any quality assurance aspect throughout entire development lifecycle.\n",
